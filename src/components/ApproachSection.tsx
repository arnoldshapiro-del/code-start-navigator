            Unlike many psychiatrists that only prescribe medication, or programs that can only offer therapy, 
            our practice is based on the research-proven fact that patients who require mental health care often 
            respond best to a combination of therapy and medication. In our practice, we can provide both therapy 
            and medication management.
